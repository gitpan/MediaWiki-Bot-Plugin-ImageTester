Revision history for ImageTester

0.2.1 DCOLLINS December 30 2008
	Changes made since 0.2.0:
		* 0.2.0 was released this morning at about 12:30 AM. Now that I've slept, I see what I screwed up. The module is in there twice becuase I had extracted the last version, and didn't clean up. This release is to simply clean up the directory.
